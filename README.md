# Building a Doctor Blading Device for Material Deposition

## Abstract
This project focuses on the design and fabrication of a custom doctor-blading device tailored for coating materials onto substrates. The device integrates a replaceable blade, an adjustable mechanism to customize blade positioning, and a sliding rail system for smooth, controlled motion. With compact dimensions (approximately 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm), it ensures adaptability and precision for material coating applications. This manual, aluminum-based construction emphasizes functionality and versatility.

## Introduction
Doctor blading, or tape casting, is a critical method for producing thin films on large-area surfaces. Developed in the 1940s, it originally enabled the fabrication of thin ceramic sheets for capacitors. Today, it finds applications in ceramics, solar cells, and protective coatings. The technique ensures uniform wet films by controlling the gap between a blade and substrate.

### Key Features of the Device
- **Compact Design**: Dimensions of approximately 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm.
- **Adjustable Blade Mechanism**: Allows precision in material coating thickness.
- **Replaceable Components**: Ensures easy maintenance and adaptability.

## Working Principle
The device operates on the principle of controlled slurry deposition:
1. **Slurry Preparation**: Homogeneous slurry of materials (e.g., ceramics, polymers) with binders and solvents.
2. **Deposition**: The slurry spreads across a substrate under a stationary or moving blade.
3. **Thickness Control**: Adjustable gap between blade and substrate determines film thickness.
4. **Drying and Curing**: The wet film solidifies, creating uniform coatings.
