Doctor Blading Device for Material Deposition
This repository contains information about the design and fabrication of a custom Doctor Blading Device tailored for coating materials onto substrates. The device integrates a replaceable blade, adjustable mechanisms, and a sliding rail system for precise, smooth material deposition.

Abstract
The project focuses on building a compact (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm), aluminum-based doctor-blading device. It emphasizes functionality and versatility, offering adaptability to specific material coating requirements. The design ensures precise control over film thickness and uniformity, making it suitable for diverse applications in material science.

Features
Replaceable Blade: For customizable operation.
Adjustable Mechanism: Allows precise control of blade positioning.
Sliding Rail System: Ensures smooth motion and even film deposition.
Compact Design: Facilitates portability and usability.
Working Principle
1. Slurry Preparation
A homogenous mixture of particles, binders, and solvents is prepared for deposition.

2. Deposition on Substrate
The slurry is placed ahead of the doctor blade and spread evenly over the substrate.

3. Film Formation
The blade distributes the slurry uniformly, creating a wet film.

4. Thickness Control
The gap between the blade and substrate determines the film's thickness.

5. Drying and Solidification
Solvents are evaporated from the wet film to form a solid layer.

Applications
Solar cells
Capacitors
Sensors
Protective coatings
Fabrication Methodology
The doctor blade device was fabricated using precise machining and assembly techniques.
